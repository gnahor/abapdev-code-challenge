<h1>SAP Developer Code Challenge – Open-Source ABAP</h1>

The challenge is straightforward. Each week, you will be asked to explore a specific open-source project, which will allow you to learn what the projects offer and how you can use them. Be sure to circle back to this blog post to learn about the next week’s challenge. And don’t worry, we’ll provide resources to help you along the way.

Interesting challenge entries may be highlighted in upcoming posts, videos, or live streams by the Developer Advocates; and of course, will be appreciated by the SAP Community members.
